## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20.9.0 or higher.
- **Text editor**: We recommend VS Code with and adding  
  `".xylit": "js"` as [Language Identifier](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers).


<Aside type="tip">
  Xylit does not have any Plugins for Syntax Highligting and IntelliSense right now.
  As workaround you can install [Inline HTML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pushqrdx.inline-html) 
  & annotate the `style` literal with the respective language (e.g. `/*scss*/`).

## Install from the CLI wizard

**_...Comming Soon! The wizard has not been developed, yet..._**

## Manual Setup

This guide will walk you through the steps to manually install and configure a new project.
If you prefer not to use the automatic create xylit CLI tool, you can set up your project yourself by following the guide below.

<Steps>

1. **Create your directory**

    Create an empty directory with the name of your project, and then navigate into it.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-xylit-project
    cd my-xylit-project
    ```
    Once you are in your new directory, create your project `package.json` file. 
    This is how you will manage your project dependencies, including Xylit. 
    If you aren’t familiar with this file format, run the following command to create one.

    ```bash
    npm init --yes
    ```
2. **Install Xylit**

    First, install the Xylit project dependencies inside your project.

    ```bash
    npm install @xylit/ssg
    ```

    Xylit Projects are ESM only. You have to add the `type` definition to you `package.json`:

    ```json
    "type": "module",
    ```

    Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "xylit dev",
      "build": "xylit build",
    },
    ```

    You’ll use these scripts later in the guide to start Astro and run its different commands.
3. **Create your first page**

    In your text editor, create a new file in your directory at `index.xylit`.
    This will be your first Xylit page in the project.

    For this guide, copy and paste the following code snippet into your new file:

    ```js
    export default html`
      <html>
        <body>
          <h1>Hello World </h1>
        </body>
      </html>
    `;

    style/*css*/`
      h1 { color: azure; }
    `;
    ```
4. **Create `xylit.config.js`
    Xylit is configured using `xylit.config.js`. 
    This file is optional if you do not need to configure Xylit, 
    but you may wish to create it now.

    Create `xylit.config.js` at the root of your project, 
    and copy the code below into it:

    ```js
    export default {};
    ```

    Read Xylits' [configuration reference](/reference/configuration) for more information.

5. You can now start the Xylit DevServer with `npm run dev`.
